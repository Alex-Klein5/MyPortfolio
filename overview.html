    <h1> Alexander Klein - An Overview </h1> 
    <section class="introduction"> 
        <p> My name is Alexander Michael Leonard Klein, and I am a recent college grauduate in search of a job. I am 25 years old now, and I would say that my best quality is my intelligence. I have enjoyed computers, astronomy, and animals my entire life. Those three things are indeed my main passions. I also love my family and my friends, and I enjoy food, music, and reading. Though I began life in Romania, I am most definitely from Silver Spring, Maryland on the East Coast of the United States. I am an American through and through. Besides gaming and roleplaying, I enjoy reading, writing, and studying electronics and electricity as a hobby. Finally, my dream job is to become an Astrophysicist. </p>
